## Big Datasets

 * Parallel processing with Dask
 * Piplelines for processing lots of files
 * Running analyses in the PBS Queue
 * GNU Parallel on compute nodes

I'm not sure what to do with those:
 * Writing Python scripts
 * Testing analysis scripts
I think it might be better in a generic Python introduction? It might be more advanced than basic intro but seems out of place here.
And there is no generic Python intro so far in any parts of the training plan. Should be one added to Generic Knowledge? Or at the 
start of Data Analysis? Although there is a code development part that talks about Python and debugging and testing (I think). To check.
