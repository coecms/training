 the title: "Publishing data linked to a paper"  This is not necessarily different from publishing data for any other purpouse 
   1st point I would delete it: I've never heard of someone been asked to pay a fee, I suppose if you mean to publish in a journal repository that requires payment? I would say that's unlikley and I wouyldn't put that upfront Could just be an additional comment in the actual trining material.
  I've added an extra point to illustrate what the workflow is i.e. DMP - publishing metadata - DOI - publishing files
  3rd/4th point: I think that is a part of the journal Open access policies, it shouldn't affect a lot how you publish the data, only "embargo" timing, in any case is not on the same level as the other points.
