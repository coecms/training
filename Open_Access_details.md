There are two main reasons to publish your data. The first is to provide a new dataset for use to the community. The second is to comply with Open Access requirements either from the journal you want to publish in or the ARC. Hence, knowing what requirements you are held to is the start in publishing data.

### Open Access Data
 * What is Open Access?
 * The ARC policy about Open Access
 * The CLEx institutions policies about Open Access
 * The journals policies about Open Access.
 * What data you should publish.
