There are two main reasons to publish your data. The first is to provide a new dataset for use to the community. The second is to comply with Open Access requirements either from the journal you want to publish with, your institution or the ARC. Hence, knowing what requirements you are held to is the start in publishing data.

### Open Access Data
 * What is Open Access?
 * The ARC policy about Open Access
 * Institutional policies about Open Access
 * The journals policies about Open Access. Which journals have policies compatible with the ARC requirements
 * What data repositories are available to you.

!!! a few comments:
I added the instituions
changed stores with repositories which is a term most often used 
I've also moved that to the end of the list I think it might be better to talk about how Open Access is interepreted before talking of repositories that provide open access

I'm not sure about  the "Which journals have policies compatible with ..." I think all journals policies are compatible with the ARC. The ARC is usually less prescriptive, they state you should publish your data but not saying how.
