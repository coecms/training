 ## Generic
 To be known by all:
 - bash
    - File and folder navigation: `cd`, `rm`, `mv`, `mkdir`, `ln`, `rsync`
    - Finding stuff: `diff`, `find`, `grep`
 - git
    - clone/init
    - add/commit
    - branching
    - merging (resolve conflicts)
    - pull/push
    - pull requests (optional)
 - Python
    - basics (v3, not v2)
 - File formats
    - How to open them (local and openDAP) and read info from them. And main differences between formats:
        - binary is not self-describing
        - grib needs a separate file that describes the data
        - netcdf is self-describing, based on hdf but with some additional conventions
    - netcdf
    - binary (both plain and fortran binary)
    - grib
    - hdf ?
    - shapefiles and other GIS ? Probably optional.
 - ncview
    - make sure they have played with all the buttons :)
 - nco
    - ncks
        - add attributes
        - extract variables or remove variables
        - subset along dimensions
    - ncecat/ncrcat: difference between the "e" and the "r"
    - ncdiff
 - cdo
    - I never use it so I don't know its functions but I'm sure there are a tonne that would be useful to know, I only know `cdo diffn`
 - text editor
    - They need to make sure they know their favourite editor. Or do we want to introduce them to IDE? 

## Running model
 - NCI
    - ssh
        - `-Y`
        - `.ssh/config`
        - ssh keys
    - PBS
        - how SU are counted
        - useful `qsub` options (not to forget `-W umask`)
        - `nqstat`, `qcat`, `qdel` (`qstat -f` ?)
    - Filesystem:
        - differences bw `home`, `short`, `gdata`, `mdss`
    - Monitoring usage:
        - `nci_account`
        - `ncimonitor`
        - `X_files_report`
    - Managing usage:
        - `ncdu`, `mdssdiff`, `nccompress`, `find`
 - Fortran
    - mpi: basic understanding of cpus and scaling. Not developing with mpi
    - openmp (optional)
    - compilation: useful options, linking (local and to libraries)
    - makefile: basic understanding to be able to read most parts of a Makefile
    - namelist: understand the format
 - Model specific
    - configuration system
    - understand how to navigate to and read the model log(s) to find errors

## Data Analysis
 - Python
    - basics (v3.x not v2)
    - xarray
    - matplotlib
    - different packages depending on interest (stats package, specific plotting package)
    - GIS in Python?
 - VDI
