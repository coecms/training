Before you go ahead:
my overall feeling is that like for all our documents the granularity is a bit unclear.
For example in Project there's some really minor steps while the first point of Monitor include a lot of commands.
I've outlined below a few suggestions also indicating what I think are prerequisites #pq or there might be an overlap -> 
It's just an example to explain what I think might be a more even granularity rather then a comment on content. 

### Setup

 * Pre-requisite: [Using projects at NCI](Introduction_to_NCI.md)
 * Pre-requisite: [Filesystems at NCI](Introduction_to_NCI.md)
 * Pre-requisire: [Project accounting at NCI](Introduction_to_NCI.md)
 * Find and join the appropriate CLEx project
 * Know the resource management processes for this project
 * Determining resources required, e.g. running model, analysing data
    - Compute resources (KSU)
    - Storage resources (GB): short term (`/short`), medium term (`/gdata`) and archive (`mdss`)
 * Contact project coordinator with resource request as required # (isn't a bit redudant? they should have started a dialogue already)

### Monitor resource use

 * Review of the tools available to you
   * NCI tools
   * CLEx tools
   * bash commands

### Managing storage

 * Pre-requisite: [Filesystems at NCI](Introduction_to_NCI.md)
 * More on correct use of NCI filesystems
 * Managing file ownership and permissions
 * File compression 
 * Prepare data for safe keeping over medium term or longer:
   * what can be deleted
   * documentation
   * tarring
 * Transfer the data:
   * across filesystems
   * from/to remote server
   * from/to tape
